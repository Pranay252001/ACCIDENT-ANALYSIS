# ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS
This project gives insightful reports and dashboards of a comprehensive understanding of road safety trends, contributing factors, and potential areas for improvement. Using mysql and powerBI i created this dashboard for better understanding of road accidents.

Features
1. Data Exploration
Explore and analyze road accident data from various perspectives, including geographical distribution, time trends, and severity levels.

2. Interactive Dashboards
Utilize interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize complex data relationships and trends dynamically. Users can interact with the visualizations to gain deeper insights into the provided data.

3. Geographic Mapping
Leverage Power BI's mapping capabilities to visually represent accident locations and identify high-risk areas. This feature helps in understanding the spatial distribution of accidents.

4. Time-Series Analysis
Examine temporal patterns of road accidents, identifying patterns based on days of the week, months, or specific time intervals. This analysis can be crucial for identifying time-specific safety concerns.

5. Severity Analysis
Analyze accident severity factors to understand the impact of various variables on the outcome of road incidents. This information can be valuable for designing targeted safety interventions.

Technologies Used
